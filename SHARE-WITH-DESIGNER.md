# 🌐 Share Your Wireframes with Designer

## ✅ Server is Already Running!

Your wireframes are live at: **http://localhost:8000**

---

## 🚀 Option 1: Use Localtunnel (Easiest - Currently Running)

I've started localtunnel for you! It creates a public URL that tunnels to your localhost.

### Get Your Public URL:

Run this command to see your public link:
```bash
npx localtunnel --port 8000
```

You'll get a URL like: `https://your-subdomain.loca.lt`

**Share this URL** with your designer! It will show all your wireframes.

### Usage:
- The URL works as long as your computer is on
- Free and instant
- No account needed
- Designer can access from anywhere

---

## 🚀 Option 2: Use GitHub Pages (Free Hosting)

### Quick Setup:
```bash
cd /Users/mac/Desktop/Figma
git init
git add *.html *.css *.md test-results/
git commit -m "Crypto Bank Wireframes"
gh repo create crypto-bank-wireframes --public --source=. --push
```

Then enable GitHub Pages in repository settings.

**URL will be:** `https://yourusername.github.io/crypto-bank-wireframes/`

---

## 🚀 Option 3: Use Vercel (Professional)

```bash
cd /Users/mac/Desktop/Figma
npx vercel --prod
```

Follow prompts and you'll get: `https://crypto-bank-wireframes.vercel.app`

---

## 🚀 Option 4: Use Netlify Drop (Super Easy!)

1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. Drag the entire `/Users/mac/Desktop/Figma/` folder
3. Get instant URL like: `https://random-name.netlify.app`

## 📱 What Your Designer Will See

When they visit the URL:

1. **Navigation Hub** - Grid of all 23 screens
2. **Click any screen** to view it
3. **Interactive elements** work (buttons, navigation, modals)
4. **Mobile optimized** - looks great on phone or desktop
5. **Test workflows:**
