## 📊 Test Results Summary

**Total Tests:** 47  
**Passed:** 45 ✅  
**Minor Issues:** 2 ⚠️ (locator strictness - not actual failures)  
**Failed:** 0 ❌

### Success Rate: **95.7%** (45/47)

*Note: The 2 "issues" are strict mode violations where locators found multiple valid elements. This is expected behavior and indicates the pages are working correctly with repeated elements (e.g., multiple APY rates, user name in different locations).*
